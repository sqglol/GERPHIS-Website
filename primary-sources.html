									<h3>I. Chu-Fan-Chi</h3>
									<p> 
										The Chu-Fan-Chi (variously translated as A Description of Barbarian Nations, Records of Foreign People) is a 13th-century Chinese geographical treatise written by Zhao Rukuo. 
										The work is a collection of descriptions of countries and various products from outside China, and it is considered an important source of information on the people, customs and in particular the traded commodities of many countries in South East Asia and around the Indian Ocean during the Song Dynasty.

									<p>Friar Juan de Plasencia authored "Customs of the Tagalogs" in 1589, a foundational text detailing the social hierarchy and legal system of the Tagalog people. His work served as an essential administrative guide for the Spanish colonial government. It offers crucial insights into pre-hispanic social classes, property rights, and religious practices.</p>

									<h3>iv. Morga</h3>
									<p>Antonio de Morga was a Spanish colonial official who published "Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas" in 1609. This work is widely regarded as one of the most reliable and objective chronicles of pre-colonial and early colonial Philippine culture, governance, and maritime activities. It remains a definitive primary source for understanding the archipelago's history before widespread Spanish cultural assimilation.</p>

									<h3>vi. Sta Ines / Colin</h3>
									<p>Francisco de Santa Inés and Francisco Colín were prominent Spanish missionaries who compiled extensive historical and ethnographic data about the Philippines. Their respective chronicles document indigenous lineages, ancestral customs, and the gradual religious transitions during the Spanish conquest. These writings provide a deep look into the pre-colonial spiritual landscape and the socio-political dynamics of early Filipino societies.</p>
