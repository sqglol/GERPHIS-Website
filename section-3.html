								In the pre-colonial Philippines, transportation shaped both political authority and
								spiritual life. Leadership depended heavily on mobility and control of the waterways, as
								communities were connected by seas and rivers, as opposed to being separated Miguel de
								Loarca observed settlements were organized in <b>barangays</b>, communities that
								originally referred to boat-based groups. This was a reflection of how governance itself
								was rooted in maritime movement, and is inherently decentralized. Political authority
								rested in the hands of the datu, who exercised power within small but independent
								communities connected by water routes.
							</p>
							<blockquote>
								“This people always had chiefs, called by them datos, who governed them and were
								captains in their wars, and whom they obeyed and reverenced.”
								<cite>(Plasencia)</cite>
							</blockquote>
							<p class="infotext">
								Antonio de Morga further noted that natives “make use of those craft for trading among
								the islands,” which shows that commerce is driven by mobility, and that alliances and
								influences are expanded by it. A <b>datu</b> who controlled trade routes and maritime
								expeditions strengthened his status, due to the close ties of leadership to resource
								access and networks of exchange with leaders from other communities.
							</p>
							<blockquote>
								“Those chiefs possessed a great amount of gold, and slaves in proportion to their
								nobility.”
								<cite>(Bobadilla)</cite>
							</blockquote>
							<blockquote>
								“The chiefs in some villages had also fisheries, with established limits, and sections
								of the rivers for markets. At these no one could fish, or trade… without paying for the
								privilege…”
								<cite>(Plasencia)</cite>
							</blockquote>
							<p class="infotext">
								In addition to authority and power, religious life is just as embedded in this maritime
								setting. Juan de Plasencia’s <b>Customs of the Tagalogs</b> documented that many natives
								believed in spirits inhabiting natural elements such as stones, trees, and the waters.
								Thus, rituals were performed to seek protection and favor from gods and spirits living
								in these natural elements. Travel, fishing, and warfare were not simply considered
								physical acts. Pre-colonial Filipinos considered these spiritual undertakings requiring
								guidance from figures such as the <b>babaylan</b>, who were considered to have more
								authority than the datus themselves. This was due to the babaylan being shamans who had
								a connection to the spiritual and ancestral realms. Even cultural memory was preserved
								through movement, as accounts describe natives keeping “their ancient lore through
								songs… commonly while playing their oars.”
							</p>
							<blockquote>
								“They also worshipped the stones, rocks, reefs, and promontories of land which jut into
								the sea; and made offerings to those of rice, fish, and other like things, or fire their
								arrows at them in passing.”
								<cite>(Bobadilla)</cite>
							</blockquote>
							<blockquote>
								“Although they had no temples, they had men and women who acted as priests, who were
								called catalonan by some and babailan by others.”
								<cite>(Plasencia)</cite>
							</blockquote>
							<p class="infotext">
								While chroniclers described political structures and spiritual practices as separate
								entities, the cited accounts reveal a deeper connection: authority, belief, and
								transportation operated within the same aquatically-centered world. Control of waterways
								shaped governance, while spiritual practices reinforced stability and unity among
								maritime communities. In this manner, transportation was more than a means of travel: it
								was a foundation of both power and faith in pre-colonial Philippine society.
